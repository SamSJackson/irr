Example 2-A:
RQ: "Deep Learning: A panacea for shortcomings of traditional recommender systems?"

Abstract: 
- Investigates existing methods to approach current problems.
- Determines what is working and notes the future area of improvement.

Introduction: 
- Motivate RS.
- Discuss existing trad-RS systems.
	- Pros
	- Cons
- Introduce ML and DL approaches
	- DL success elsewhere.
	- Highlight where DL may succeed where trad-RS cannot.
- Give review limitations as well as primary objective.
- Summarise key questions/arguments
- Give structuring.

Background:
- Just some maths on trad-rs systems.
- Arguments on why DL is used (in general). 

Literature Review:
- Subsections based on RS-approaches.
- Summary of SOTA papers in their respective fields, highlighting pros and cons with respect to the DL fixing trad-RS problems.

Conclusion:
- Overview of review alongside final argument of each subsection.
- Final summary of existing research.
- Recommendation for future work.

Example 3-A:
RQ: "Evaluating the Bayesian Brain Framework in Cognitive Science"

Abstract:
- Discusses existing methods.
- Highlights review of studies pro-computational framework and anti (with specific areas).
- Discusses primary points of improvement that research review found.

Introduction:
- General motivation of topic.
- High-level description of concept.
- Discussion of exact method of answering RQ. 
- Discuss structuring of review.

(Sub-section of Intro) Background: 
- Bayes Theorem
- History and philosophical arguments of Bayes'
- No discussion of Marr? wtf are Marr's levels of analysis. Should be in background, not at start of intro. 

Literature Review:
- Essentially a back-and-forth between papers supporting Bayesian computation against Marr's levels of analysis and papers critiquing support. 

I do not like this paper. 

Limitations and Future Directions:
- Highlights lack of unity amongst researchers and should be a concerted effort to converge to a result.
- Proposes future work based on criticism in limitations. 

Conclusions:
- Summarise discussion.
- Summarise process of reviewing.
- Conclusion/final argument of review; primary future work.
