## (RQ) Methods of Improving Reliability of Social Networks for Human-Conflict Crises Response

This project has three major components:
[[Improving Reliability]]
- What does it mean for a network to be reliable?
- Methods to make a network more reliable or trustworthy. 
- Are we improving reliability before the network is used or filtering during real-time use? 
- Are there ethical concerns to methods of improving reliability (silencing individuals online)? 

[[Disaster Response]]
- How are networks being used to respond to existing disasters? 
- What disasters are being responded to? 
- How do we define human-conflict crises? 

[[Social Networks]]
- What is a social network in our case? How are they typically defined? 
- What is the background required for understanding a network? 
- How are these social networks primarily built? From which social media site?
