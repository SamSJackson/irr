The paper consists of an introduction, background and literature review. 

The following sections will contain the following content:
[[Introduction]]
- Motivation
- Examples / Real-Life Cases where Network Reliability would help
- Primary Review Questions
	1. How are Social Networks used for Real-Time Disaster Response?
	2. What are preventative methods for ensuring reliability when used in Disaster Response? 
	3. Are these reliability techniques sufficient or specialised for dealing with Human-Based Crises Response?
