## What are Networks? 
A *Network*, $G$, is defined as a set of nodes, $N$, and set of edges, $E$. Nodes are connected by edges. For an undirected graph, an edge could be defined as $(x,y)$ between nodes $x$ and $y$. If $G$ was a directed graph, $(x,y)$ would be an edge from $x$ to $y$ explicitly. 

A *Social Network* is a Network which is created to model social interactions of a sort. A common example would be a network graph where nodes are individuals and the edges represent friendship. However, for our case, we consider *Social Networks* to be networks which are derived from a social media platform with a defined interaction.
