What is the paper about?
The paper is about identifying shares of fake news on Twitter during the 2020 US Elections. 

What is the aim of the study?
The aim of the study is to understand the ability of ordinary voters to flood social media with fake news.

Why is it important?
There is worth in this research as it helps us understand the demographic prone to spreading fake news and potentially understand preventive or pre-emptive methods to avoid this fake news spreading.

What is the approach/method used to acquire the data?
Panel of registered voters (~600k). 


What are the key findings?
- Supershares of fake news are typically older than the average Twitter user, at 58.
- Supershares of non fake-news are typically younger than the supershares of fake news (51 vs 58).
- Supershares are found to be older, right-leaning women originating from Texas, Arizona and Florida, with little difference in economic and educational status. 
- Supershares of fake news are significantly more dense than supershares of non-fake news when it comes to impact on social network (0.3% of SS-F corresponds to 80% of fake news whereas 0.3% of SS-NF corresponds to 40% of NF).

Are there any limitations?
- Sample size is predominantly caucasian (>80%). 
- Userbase of Twitter (now X) has most likely changed a lot since this was published. 
- Don't know the motivations or mechanisms that supersharers have towards sharing fake news (or non-fake news).

What are the main conclusions and implications in the wider context?
- Supersharers of fake news, contrary to stereotypes, are not young, alt-right male hackers but older, right-leaning, caucasian women. 
- 0.3% of Supersharers can contribute to 80% of the media.

- In a wider context, we can consider than we only need to focus on a subset of media accounts when it comes to limiting fake news, which speeds up computation. 
- Furthermore, less money can be spent on campaigning if these accounts (supershares) be utilised for the campaign purposes.

Any other comments?
- Recent work has shown 80% of fake news on social media is spread by a small fraction of the user base
