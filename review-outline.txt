RQ: Can we improve the reliability of social networks for real-time disaster-response? 

What to review:
- Motivation for Social Networks in Disaster Response.
- Potential issues in reliability of social networks for disaster response. 
- Existing methods of using social networks for disaster response. 
- Methods of real-time analysing social networks.

Introduction:

Major points: 
- Motivate further use-case, for both assistive and preventative measures of disaster-response.
- How are networks used for crisis events at the moment? 
- How can we analyse social networks in real-time?
- Define what reliabitlity of a network means.
- What are techniques to improve reliability at the moment?

Background:
- Networks
- Network Immunization
- Fake News Detection

Literature Review: 
Primary papers:
- CrisisFacts - method of building and evaluating crisis timelines.
- Mobility Network Models - example of network models for real-time (long-term) disaster response.
- MCWDST - method of detecting fake news in real-time across social networks (social media).
- CONTAIN - Community-based algorithm (Louvain) for network immunization (improving reliability).

Major points: 
- Methods for building crisis timelines are still being built.
- Current methods of disaster-response are primarily on mobility data.
- Focus of reliability is removing fake news (misinformation or fake news?, intention is relevant).
- Methods of improving reliability are network immunization. 

Future Work: 
- Different methods of network immunization? 
- Improvements to detecting/determining a disaster from social network? (i.e. facebook was first to know about cowgate incident). 


Conclusion:
- Just summarise. Write this at the end. No point speculating now.
